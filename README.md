# Sentimental-Analysis-
The Sentiment Analysis Website is a web-based application designed to understand and analyze human emotions expressed through text. The main goal of this project is to determine whether a given piece of text, such as a review, comment, or feedback, shows a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This helps organizations and individuals understand public opinion more easily.

In this project, users can enter text into the website through a simple and user-friendly interface. Once the text is submitted, the system processes it using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The text is cleaned by removing unnecessary symbols and common words, and then it is analyzed using a sentiment analysis model or predefined logic. Based on the words and patterns found in the text, the system predicts the sentiment and displays the result on the screen.

The backend of the website handles text processing and sentiment prediction, while the frontend focuses on presenting the input form and results clearly to the user. This project helps learners understand how machine learning models or rule-based approaches can be integrated into a web application. It also demonstrates concepts like text preprocessing, model integration, request handling, and result visualization.

Overall, the Sentiment Analysis Website project shows how AI and web technologies can work together to convert unstructured text into meaningful emotional insights. It is especially useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media comments, and online reviews.
